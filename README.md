2. import keras
3. import telegram
4. import requests
5. import tensorflow
6. import Thread
7. import playsound

***There are 4 element for this proyect.***
1. ProyectoIA_model.ipynb: This is how the model was created for the proyect.
2. SlumberSensor.h5: The model that was created and trained in 1. ProyectoIA_model.ipynb.
3. SlumberSensordetector.ipynb: This is the file that detects drowsiness with the h5 model.
4. data: The data neccesary for this proyect.
